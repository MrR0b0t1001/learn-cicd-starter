# learn-cicd-starter (Notely)

This repo contains the starter code for the "Notely" application for the "Learn CICD" course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Local Development

Make sure you're on Go version 1.22+.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```bash
PORT="8080"
```

Run the server:

```bash
go build -o notely && ./notely
```

_This starts the server in non-database mode._ It will serve a simple webpage at `http://localhost:8080`.

You do _not_ need to set up a database or any interactivity on the webpage yet. Instructions for that will come later in the course!

samael's version of Boot.dev's Notely app and mine is better.

let's see if it will work..

I can't for the life of me figure out the point of the formatting sector

everyone uses auto formatting
